## What hardware do I need?

- BoxeeBox ( See https://github.com/peec/boxee-php for info )
- X10 devices ( See https://github.com/peec/x10php for info )



## What can I do with this software

- Control your lights from anywhere in the world, play movies from anywhere.
- Create scripts that turns on lights or dims them based on days and time.
- Create one button macros that turns on audio, dims the lights and turns off/on lights.
- When starting a movie, wouldn't it be great if all your lights around the tv got dimmed ?
- More can be done, only your imagination is the limit using this website.
